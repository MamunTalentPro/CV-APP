          As a software engineer, I specialize in developing web applications using Next.js, NestJS, MongoDB, and
          GraphQL. My expertise in these technologies allows me to develop fast, scalable, secure, and customizable web
          applications. In addition to my technical skills, I have a strong desire to take on new challenges and
          continuously learn and improve. I am always seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and experience by
          working on diverse projects and tackling new and complex problems. I am confident that my passion for learning
          and willingness to take on new challenges make me a valuable asset to any team.
